	<p>&#8220;A probationary police officer was terminated from MSJC&#8217;s police force on Thursday.  It follows the resignations of another officer and a reserve officer who said they were threatened with termination after witnessing what they considered inappropriate conduct by fellow officers.&#8221;</p>
	<p>&#8220;Jensen said earlier in the day that he was handed a letter by college Police Chief Kevin Segawa that said Jensen &#8216;failed to report the misconduct of Mark Medina&#8217; a police corporal.&#8221;</p>
	<p>&#8220;The three other former officers filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the college district and two employees on Tuesday in Riverside County Superior Court, according to court records.&#8221;</p>
	<p>Blog:</p>
	<p>Police Chief Kevin Segawa was named &#8220;Chief&#8221; in a re-organization of the department by former S/P and Human Resource VP,  Jon Tyler.  An open recruitment for said position was not done.

								<p>This officer is not terminated until the BOARD terminates him in open session.  Considering all the facts and circumstances that even the public knows, the BOARD should demand a full explanation prior to the ratification and therefor agreement with the college president on this recommendation to terminate.  The board majority should reread the oath of office they took and act accordingly.  Will they?</p>

The board majority needs to take control of this matter because the administration has not.

								<p>Good personnel practices require consistancy, therefor all the employees should be warned that they must report the immoral acts of their co-workers or face termination.  And let&#8217;s report them to the VP of HR so she can descipline everybody consistantly. She probably should put out a list of reportable immoral acts so the employees know exactly what to report.</p>

								<p>I was present at yesterday’s board of trustees meeting at the San Jacinto campus.  All this time ‘Segawa supporters’ have been calling for the fired officers to come forward and be recognized.  They have!  Former Officers Jensesn, Navarrete, Kuhl and Gonzalez WERE THERE.  Kevin Segawa WAS NOT!</p>
<p>In fact, Segawa (and his documented liar of a lemming Ryan Myers) were seen running away from the BOT meeting like cowards.  Now it is VERY CLEAR to everyone who is telling the truth and who is not afraid to come forward! When you tell the truth there is nothing to run away from, Kevin. </p>
<p>Job well done Jensen (and other officers)! Many of us appreciated your coming forward at the meeting and support your actions.  I’m sure Ann will force the Roger and the college to do the right thing now.</p>

								<p>Well H.R. guy that may be true. Looks like Mark Medina is going to get fired like Scott Jensen did. Mark Medina failed to report the FACT that his boss, Kevin Segawa, stole a few hundred dollars of ice cream from a street vendor. </p>
<p>If Scott can be fired for failing to report Marks on duty extra marital affairs, which is not even a crime, how can the District NOT fire Mark Medina for failing to report felonies his boss was committing? After all Mark Medina was supposedly second in command. Wonder what his qualifications were? Can they be any less than the Chiefs? Well, maybe Mark actually graduated high school.</p>

								<p>From the looks of it, it might just be time to clear the decks and start from scratch.  Roger is a smart guy, and now, with the former administration and its self-serving ways gone, (or at least the major players), the college could form a security force of a reasonable size to maintain the campuses (and leave the rest of the county to RSO and the PDs), giving the students and staff a sense of safety and concern without spending ungodly sums of money for SWAT teams and K-9 forces.  The overblown egos have caused the death of a once-good idea.  Too bad.</p>

								<p>Ann, as an educated person, do you not find it odd that the Chief of Police has not publicly denied any of the allegations being made against him? Additionally, with all the statements being made regarding Kevins lack of qualifications and experience wouldnt you want your Chief to come out and publicly defend himself? The lack of rebuttal from Kevin Segawa is very telling. Any thoughts?</p>

								<p>Kevin should keep his mouth shut, the college is being sued. The appropriate venue is the court room.  This also limits what Ann can or should say.  Regarding his qualifications or expierence, he is not the issue.  The issue is the judgement of the person who hired him.  The president of the college needs to figure out what is going on, provide due process and descipline accordingly.  But the board majority, it appears, has not demanded this course of action.</p>

								<p>Kevin is the ISSUE! He has mismanged the department to near extinction, fired all the hard working honest officers who knew too much about his misdeeds and has ONE documented LIAR who was recommended for termination on training! </p>
<p>I can completely understand Kevin not commenting on the lawsuit. However, the only circumstance where stating your qualifications would be damaging in any legal action is if you do not possess ANY qualifications or experience! In fact, by stating your vast training and experience, this would only help in dispeling any statements made regarding his lack of qualifications. Hmmm&#8230;&#8230;now it all makes sense! He wont comment because we all know he doesnt have any!</p>

								<p>All this talk about Kevin Segawa and not one mention of Ryan Myers?  Have you all forgotten that it was Myers (the lemming of a liar) who got this ball rolling?  Remember back to the Menifeelive.com blog days (when they weren’t afraid to post the truth) when all the facts surrounding this terrible situation were laid out?  It was Ryan Myers who helped get this entire story out into the open. </p>
<p>Essentially, Myers and Medina colluded to get former officer Navarreta fired. It was Navarreta who initiated the lawsuit against MSJC, Medina and Myers (for slander). It was later learned that Myers also lied to get former officer Kuhl fired by creating a made up story. Of course, that was only after Kuhl, who was Myers training officer, recommended to chief Segawa that he be terminated for poor performance.  Myers’ was deficient in many areas of police work, but he had a particular issue with telling the truth….essentially he couldn’t!  Especially when it came to completing official police reports. </p>
<p>Myers also had a hand in the termination of Officer Jensen after attempting to attack him. Most people loose sight of Myers in this thing due to the fact he&#8217;s a little guy compared to the chief and the corporal, but don’t kid yourself.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s the direct cause of all this coming out! So the fired officer should actually be thanking Myers for his ignorance and cowardice. Myers is going to singlehandedly make the four officers VERY RICH and get himself, Medina and Segawa in the unemployment line.</p>

								<p>Sad that the people involved in the original department formation knew so little about community college policing. Community college policing is 90 percent security and 10 percent law enforcement. More time and a greater effort should have been spent locating and hiring a Police Chief with years of background in city, county, state or federal law enforcement with command college policing experience, Community colleges don’t have the resources to train their command officers and campus police officers properly, therefore they need to hire officers that have years of law enforcement experience behind them and bring with them that experience that would help form the base of their department. Retired police officers within our department have proven to be an invaluable asset to our college community. Young men and woman right out of the academy just don’t have the experience nor get the supervision needed in a college policing environment to avoid problems that MSJC is experiencing. </p>
<p>As for the Chief, the department is a reflection of his leadership. If what I read about his background is true, no P.O.S.T. Police Department in CA. (that I know of) would have considered him for employment. This chief can’t draw on experience and integrity that he apparently doesn’t have.</p>

								<p>After reading these comments it appears that everyone here has some valid points. I think that we can all agree that something has to be done immediately to protect the district. We can only hope that Roger, the BOT, and the districts new legal counsel are in continual discussions.</p>
<p>&#8220;point of order&#8221; is correct that the board must, in open session, vote and approve/disapprove any terminations. We will soon see if Roger and the BOT have the integrity to protect the district.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodhumor&#8221; is correct that there really isn&#8217;t a reason for Kevin Segawa to reveal his qualifications or lack thereof. At the price of around 100k a year shouldnt we know what we are paying for?</p>
<p>&#8220;HRGUY&#8221; has a point in that all misconduct should be reported, however, what happens when your supervisor or the head of HR commits the misconduct? Do you report it to Roger? What if he wont talk to you? The BOT? It just isn&#8217;t very clear.</p>
<p>We have all seen or heard about the blogs and newspaper articles that tell of sex on duty, dishonesty, stolen evidence, coerced resignations and much more, which have all led to lawsuits and embarrassment.</p>
<p>How is it that Mark Medina, who has undeniably violated district policy, (Sex on campus while on duty, threatening subordinates, etc)has been on PAID administrative leave for over 8 weeks?</p>
<p>How is it that Ryan Myers, Who has violated district policy including lying, threatening to lie, threatening a district employee with harmful acts up to and including death,acts of violence in the workplace (zero tolerance?), and has had many formal substantiated complaints reported to HR, is not on any kind of leave pending an legitimate investigation?</p>
<p>How is it that Kevin Segawa who, violated district policy, broke the law, placed the district in an extremely liable position, and has almost none of the qualifications required to manage any department let alone a police department, is not on any form of administrative leave pending a legitimate investigation?</p>
<p>What is the true relationship between Dr. Tyler, Zampi &amp; assoc., Irma Ramos and Kevin Segawa?</p>
<p>Will Roger and the BOT conduct a investigation before it&#8217;s too late? </p>
<p>These are all questions that we all hope that Roger and the BOT find answers to before the January meeting.</p>

								<p>Are any of the other four trustees paying attention to these comments, or inviting comments in some other forum?  Ann&#8217;s on the ball, and I&#8217;ll bet Roger is, too, but the rest of &#8216;em have to get on board and show a little interest in righting some of the wrongs that began in previous administrations. The PD is only part of it but cleaning it up would go a long way toward restoring confidence in the district.  Do we have any clue how the other four are viewing this fiasco?</p>

								<p>MSJCCD should eliminate the college police department and contract with the Sheriff&#8217;s Department for professional police service. The Los Angeles Community College District had similar problems and they contracted with the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#8217;s Department years ago.<br />
Contracting is the way to go; it&#8217;s more cost effective. Contracting out for police services seems to be working out fine for fifteen cities in Riverside County, especially with today&#8217;s economy!</p>

<p>Top college police placed on leave<br />
Investigation involve the chief and his deputy at Irvine Valley campus.<br />
By MARLA JO FISHER<br />
The Orange County Register</p>
<p>IRVINE – Both of the top police officers at Irvine Valley College have been sent home on paid leave and their computers seized, pending an investigation into unspecified allegations, officials confirmed Friday.</p>
<p>The reason for the probe was not disclosed. College President Glenn Roquemore said he could not discuss the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it will be a speedy process and the matter will be resolved,&#8221; Roquemore said.</p>
<p>Reached at their homes, Police Chief Owen Kreza and his deputy police chief, Dennis W. Duncan, both said they did not know why they were placed on leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t give you any information, because I don&#8217;t have any,&#8221; Kreza said. &#8220;I&#8217;m at a total loss.&#8221;</p>
<p>His deputy chief, Duncan, who retired from a long career as a sheriff&#8217;s deputy before coming to work at IVC, said he had not been contacted by any investigator since he was sent home a week ago Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told not to say anything,&#8221; Duncan, 52, said. &#8220;Anyone, at any time, can make an allegation. My conscience is clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy police chief at Saddleback College, James Pyle, is temporarily filling in as the top officer. He declined to comment.</p>
<p>The matter is administrative, not criminal, and outside law enforcement has not been contacted, said Tracy Daly, spokeswoman for the South Orange County Community College District, which operates the college.</p>
<p>Kreza, 59, was hired by the college in 2001, after retiring from the Irvine Police Department and later working for UC Irvine and Concordia University and running his own executive protection agency.</p>
<p>College officials would not disclose his salary or Duncan&#8217;s except to say that Kreza&#8217;s pay range was $75,072 to $112,609 and Duncan&#8217;s was $67,565 to $101,237. Neither man had a contract, spokeswoman Daly said.</p>
<p>Kreza told the Irvine World News in 2001 that he had provided security to country music stars, business moguls and the family of the Sultan of Brunei.</p>
<p>On Friday, Kreza Professional Services remained listed on the Findlaw.com Web site as a consulting company for legal investigations based in Foothill Ranch.</p>
<p>In September 1993, the Los Angeles Times reported that Kreza was among five Irvine Police Department officers facing internal discipline.</p>
<p>City officials would not specify the reason for the discipline, except to say it stemmed from a internal investigation into a lawsuit by female officers alleging that some Irvine cops belonged to a &#8220;Code Four Club&#8221; into which male officers were inducted after having sex in the back of a patrol car while on duty.</p>
<p>After the investigation, city officials said they found no evidence of such a club, but announced they would discipline five officers for unspecified offenses discovered during the probe, none of which were criminal.</p>
<p>On Friday, Kreza said vehemently that he&#8217;d &#8220;had nothing to do with that Code Four Club&#8221; and that it was not related to his 1993 suspension by the city police department.</p>
<p>&#8220;My suspension was related to secondary employment,&#8221; Kreza said. &#8220;I had applied for secondary employment. It was a mess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kreza is on the board of directors of the Exchange Club of Irvine, which has as its credo, in part, that members should &#8220;consecrate my best energies to the uplifting of Social, Religious, Political and Business ideals… (and to) honor and respect the law.&#8221;</p>

								<p>An interesting article from the November 2008 Newsletter of the California College and University Police Chiefs Association.</p>
<p>&#8220;CAMPUS POLICE DEPARTMENTS UNDER REVIEW</p>
<p>Three of the last non-POST community college police departments are under scrutiny by college administration. Pat McCurry, Chief, San Bernardino Community College District reports his agency has been accepted into the POST program after years of scrutiny and evaluations by the college.</p>
<p>Mark Snyder, Chief, Antelope Valley College indicates POST is evaluating personnel for inclusion into the POST program. Snyder is also reviewing enforcement procedures and internal discipline issues.</p>
<p>Craig Baumbusch took over the duties as Chief for Victor Valley College. The College suspended all police authority pending an evaluation of training and selection standards of the officers. The officers weapons were removed, the words &#8220;POLICE&#8221; on the vehicles were taped over and the &#8220;POLICE&#8221; patches were taken off the uniforms at the direction of the college president. After a review of the officers&#8217; training and backgrounds, about half of the staff were reinstated and the police department was re-established. A request to be admitted into POST is still under review by the college president.</p>
<p>Of the 111 community colleges, 72 maintain a police presence. 18 colleges contract with the local law enforcement agency, and 54 maintain their own PD. Ohlone, Cerritos, San Francisco, Pasadena, and Sierra are not armed. Antelope Valley and Victor Valley are the only campuses of the 145 public institutions of higher education that are not in the POST program.&#8221;</p>

								<p>This is a great find. Sadly, the current administration or B.O.T of MSJC has neither the courage or knowledge to make such a bold move. It appears with all the internal conflict of interests being uncovered at MSJC status quo will prevail and a UNQUALIFIED, CRIMINAL police chief will continue to run the department with his ONE documented liar of an officer.</p>

								<p>The holidays, and our vacation, are over. Now that we are all back to work, i would hope that something is being done to remedy this situation.</p>
<p>Why has nothing been done? Will Roger and the board allow this type of conduct? It seem like at the district should be placing the remaining officer and chief on some sort of administrative leave?</p>
<p>I think we are at risk at this point having any of these people at our campuses. I would guess that the Sheriff or someone else is investigating these allegations. </p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need more embarrassment.</p>

								<p>Ann, at the next B.O.T. meeting will the Board be requesting an explanation as to why a Police Chief who has been accused of theft and violating an individuals civil rights has not been placed on leave pending an investigation? What kind of example does that set for the other employees of the District?</p>
